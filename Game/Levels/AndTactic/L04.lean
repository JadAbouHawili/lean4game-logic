Introduction "
# `cases` for a Conjunction
Here, we introduce the `cases` tactic in an unstructured context. `cases` takes a name from the local context and either splits it into multiple goals, or deconstructs it into its parts depending on the Proposition.\\
\\
In this level, `cases h` will replace `h` with its `left` and `right` parts. Try it out.
