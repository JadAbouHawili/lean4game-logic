## Summary

If the goal is a statement `P`, then `exact h` will close the goal if `h` is a proof of `P`.

### Example

If the goal is `x = 37` and you have a hypothesis `h : x = 37`
then `exact h` will solve the goal.

### Example

If the goal is `x + 0 = x` then `exact add_zero x` will close the goal.

### Exact needs to be exactly right

Note that `exact add_zero` will *not work* in the previous example;
for `exact h` to work, `h` has to be *exactly* a proof of the goal.
`add_zero` is a proof of `âˆ€ n, n + 0 = n` or, if you like,
a proof of `? + 0 = ?` where `?` needs to be supplied by the user.
This is in contrast to `rw` and `apply`, which will \"guess the inputs\"
if necessary. If the goal is `x + 0 = x` then `rw [add_zero]`
and `rw [add_zero x]` will both change the goal to `x = x`,
because `rw` guesses the input to the function `add_zero`.
