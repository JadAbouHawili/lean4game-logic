# Lean 4 Logic Game

## Getting Started

There are multiple ways to run the game while developing it:

### Local setup

The full instructions are at [Running games locally](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md#running-games-locally).
In particular, the recommended setup is to have `docker` installed on your computer
and then click on the pop-up "Reopen in Container" which is shown when
opening this project in VSCode.

The game is then accessible at [localhost:3000/#/g/local/game](http://localhost:3000/#/g/local/game).
